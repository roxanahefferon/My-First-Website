# My very first webpage

Welcome!

This project was created on Cloud9 as part of my full stack developer diploma with Code Academy. It's my first coding approach as I'm learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. While building it I got an introductory overview of Git and GitHub as well.
It was created to put some of the knowledge to work together; it shows the different languages and platforms we will be learning throughout the course. Putting it together I've reinforced my understanding of the html structure, adding images and links to other pages and some css styling.
